<ul>
<lI>Near the center of the area in which your wireless stations will operate.</lI>
<lI>In an elevated location such as a high shelf.</lI>
<lI>Away from the potential sources of interference, such as PCs, microwaves, 
and cordless phones.</lI>
<lI>With the Antenna in the upright position.</lI>
<lI>Away from large metal surfaces.</lI>
</ul>

<p><B>Note</B>: Failure to follow these guidelines can result in significant performance degradation or inability to wirelessly connect to the AP.</p>
<p><B>Operation Mode</B> - Several Operation Modes are supported, including: (1)Access Point (2)Client (3)Repeater (4)Bridge with AP. The available setting options are different in various operation modes, and they are explained below.</p>

<ul>
<lI><B>SSID</B> - Enter a value of up to 32 characters. The same Name (SSID) must be assigned to all wireless devices in your network. In Multi-SSID operation mode,  enter SSID for each BSS in the field "SSID1" ~ "SSID4".</lI>
<lI><strong>Region</strong> - Select your region from the pull-down list. This field specifies the region where the wireless function of the AP can be used. It may be illegal to use the wireless function of the AP in a region other than one of those specified in this filed. If your country or region is not listed, please contact your local government agency for assistance.</lI>
<lI><B>Channel</B> - This field determines which operating frequency will be used. It is not necessary to change the wireless channel unless you notice interference problems with another nearby access point. </lI>
<lI><B>Mode</B> -This field determines the wireless mode which the AP works on.</lI>
<lI><B>Channel Width</B> - The bandwidth of the wireless channel.</lI>
<lI><B>Enable Wireless Radio</B> - The wireless radio of the AP can 
be enabled or disabled to allow or deny wireless stations to access. If enabled, the wireless

not be able to access the AP.</lI>
<lI><B>Enable SSID Broadcast</B> - If you select the <B>Enable SSID Broadcast</B> 
checkbox, the AP will broadcast its name (SSID) on the air. </lI>
</ul>

</UL>

<p><B>Repeater</B> - In Repeater mode, the AP with WDS disabled will relays data to an associated root AP. AP function is enabled meanwhile. The wireless repeater relays signal between its stations and the root AP for greater wireless range. Please input the MAC address of root AP in the field <B>"MAC of AP"</B>.</p>

<p><B>Bridge with AP</B> - This operation mode bridges two APs to connect two LANs.</p>
<UL>
